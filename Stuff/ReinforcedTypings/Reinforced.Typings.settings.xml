		Hi! This is settings file for Reinforced.Typings.
		Since Reinforced.Typings is not a framework itself but build process extension,
		therefore settings file is basically piece of MSBuild script.
		This file is being imported to your .csproj during each build the same way
		as Reinforced.Typings.targets that is located in its package /build directory.
		
		Reinforced.Typings has completely few parameters. So, here we go.
